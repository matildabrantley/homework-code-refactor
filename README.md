## Goals for Code Refactor

### A webpage meets accessibility standards:
* WHEN I view the source code
  * THEN I find semantic HTML elements
* WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
  * THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* WHEN I view the image elements
  * THEN I find accessible alt attributes
* WHEN I view the heading attributes
  * THEN they fall in sequential order
* WHEN I view the title element
  * THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
